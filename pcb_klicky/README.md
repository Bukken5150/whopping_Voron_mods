# PCB Klicky

Based on two legends: the [Klicky Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe) by JosAr and the [Euclid Probe](https://euclidprobe.github.io)

This design attempts to replicate Klicky as closely as possible using a PCB-based design, to try and achieve the following aims:

1. Reduce the problem of magnets working lose or seating poorly in printed parts
2. Increase the current being switched, which might *possibly* result in a [longer switch lifetime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5BhECVlKJA&t=4s).
3. Add LEDs.

## Beta test

Please check back soon for assembly instructions.
