Alternate version of WP's GE5C mod...

The objectives of this modification were to:

1. Allow the use of a M5x20 button head screw instead of the M5x25 socket head

2. To remove the need for more than 1 M5 shim per joint

3. Provide room for loosening and tightening the M3 lower z joint clamp while everything is assembled. (This allows re-squaring the gantry while everything is assembled.)

Installation instructions are similar to WP's modification with the following changes:  Use a M5x20 button head (a socket head would also work) screw instead of the M5x25 SHCS, use a M3x12 socket or button head as the second screw for the lower z joint clamp, and only use a single 1mm M5 shim per corner.
